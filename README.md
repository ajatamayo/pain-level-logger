# What's this for?

Just a way to track my daily level of pain. I found that this is what's relevant to my doctor.

# How does it work?

Essentially, you get a calendar and you get to set the level of pain you have for that day on a scale of `0` to `10`. `0` for no pain, `1` to `10` for varying levels of pain with `10` being the highest, and `11` for unbearable pain.

# Is this medically accurate for all types of pain?

No. This is specifically catered to my pain which is caused by **Trigeminal Neuralgia**.

# Why does the scale go up to 11?

Because that's how it feels to have **Trigeminal Neuralgia**.
